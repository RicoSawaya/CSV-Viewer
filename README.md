# CSV viewer
A simple GUI that allows you to see, expand, add, edit, and delete a CSV file in a user-friendly and simple way!


It's a very self-explanatory code!
I know this code seems pretty useless because you could just use Excel, but I like it a lot because it has a straightforward GUI while Excel can sometimes look messy and overwhelming.

If you would like to use this code yourself, the only thing you would have to change is the "pastSearchesPath" variable on line 9 of the code. Make sure
that it is an empty txt document and the code will work its magic. This is the text document that stores the past searches so you do not have to type in the CSV file
every time you want to open it.
