# CSVRowAdder
A simple GUI that adds rows to any CSV file.


It's a very self-explanatory code!
I put a bunch of comments to show what I am doing as well, I know this code seems pretty useless because you could just use Excel, but I like it a lot because it has a very simple GUI while Excel can look messy and overwhelming at times.
